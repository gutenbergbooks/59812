                         GOOSEY, GOOSEY, GANDER


  Goosey, Goosey, Gander,
  Where shall I wander?
  Upstairs and downstairs
  And in my lady’s chamber.

  There I met an old man
  That would not say his prayers,
  So I took him by the left leg
  And threw him down stairs.

                       MARY, MARY, QUITE CONTRARY


  “Mary, Mary, quite contrary,
    How does your garden grow?”
  “With silver bells and cockle shells,
    And pretty maids all in a row.”

                             YANKEE-DOODLE


  Yankee-doodle came to town
    Upon a little pony,
  He stuck a feather in his hat
    And called it macaroni.

        Yankee-doodle, doodle-do,
          Yankee-doodle dandy;
        All the lasses are so smart,
          And sweet as sugar candy.

  Marching in and marching out,
    And marching round the town, O!
  Here there comes a regiment
    With Captain Thomas Brown, O!

        Yankee-doodle, etc.

  Yankee-doodle is a tune
    That comes in very handy;
  The enemy all runs away
    At Yankee-doodle dandy.

                      HUMPTY DUMPTY SAT ON A WALL


  Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,
  Humpty Dumpty had a great fall:
  All the King’s horses and all the King’s men
  Couldn’t pick up Humpty Dumpty again.

                   HERE WE GO ROUND THE MULBERRY BUSH


  1. Here we go round the Mulberry Bush,
    The Mulberry Bush, the Mulberry Bush;
    Here we go round the Mulberry Bush
    On a cold and frosty morning.

  2. This is the way we wash our hands,
    We wash our hands, we wash our hands;
    This is the way we wash our hands
    On a cold and frosty morning.

  3. This is the way we dry our hands,
    We dry our hands, we dry our hands, etc.

  4. This is the way we clap our hands,
    We clap our hands, we clap our hands, etc.

  5. This is the way we warm our hands,
    We warm our hands, we warm our hands, etc.

                  THREE MICE WENT INTO A HOLE TO SPIN


  Three mice went into a hole to spin;
  Puss passed by, and Puss looked in.
  “What are you doing, my little men?”
  “Weaving coats for gentlemen.”
  “Please let me help you to wind off your threads.”
  “Ah, no, Mistress Pussy, you’d bite off our heads,”
  “Ah, no, Mistress Pussy, you’d bite off our heads.”

  Says Puss, “You look so wondrous wise,
  I like your whiskers and bright eyes;
  Your house is the nicest house I see
  I think there is room for you and me.”
  The mice were so pleased that they opened the door,
  And Pussy soon laid them all dead on the floor,
  And Pussy soon laid them all dead on the floor.

                    DAME, GET UP AND BAKE YOUR PIES


  Dame, get up and bake your pies,
    Bake your pies, bake your pies;
  Dame, get up and bake your pies
    On Christmas Day in the morning.

  Dame, what makes your maidens lie?
    Maidens lie, maidens lie?
  Dame, what makes your maidens lie
    On Christmas Day in the morning?

  Dame, what makes your ducks to die?
    Ducks to die, ducks to die?
  Dame, what makes your ducks to die
    On Christmas Day in the morning?

  Their wings are cut, they cannot fly,
    Cannot fly, cannot fly;
  Their wings are cut, they cannot fly
    On Christmas Day in the morning.

                         THE BABES IN THE WOOD


  My dears, you must know,
  That a long time ago,
  Two poor little children,
  Whose names I don’t know,
  Were stolen away
  On a fine Summer’s day
  And left in the Wood,
  As I’ve heard the folks say.
      Poor Babes in the Wood!
      Poor Babes in the Wood!
      Don’t you remember
      The Babes in the Wood?

  And when it was night
  So sad was their plight,
  The sun it went down
  And the moon gave no light.
  They sobbed and they sighed
  And they bitterly cried,
  And the poor little things
  They lay down and died.
      Poor Babes in the Wood!
      Poor Babes in the Wood!
      Don’t you remember
      The Babes in the Wood?

  And when they were dead
  The Robins so red
  Brought strawberry leaves
  To over them spread.
  Then all the day long
  The branches among
  They mournfully whistled
  And this was their song.
      Poor Babes in the Wood, etc.

                             OLD KING COLE


  Old King Cole was a merry old soul,
  And a merry old soul was he;
  And he called for his pipe,
  And he called for his bowl,
  And he called for his fiddlers three.

  Ev’ry fiddler had a fiddle fine,
    A very fine fiddle had he;
  Then tweedle-dee went the fiddlers three,
    And so merry we will be.

                               BABY JOHN


  Counting by the years they’ve past,
      Ben and Sue,
      Kate and Prue
  Come first and Baby John comes last.

  But when bedtime comes, ’tis said,
      Then poor Sue
      And Ben and Prue
      And even Kate
      Must now come last,
      And wait
      Quite late,
      Till Baby John is fast
          A-bed.
